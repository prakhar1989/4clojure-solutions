4clojure solutions
===

[My](http://www.4clojure.com/user/prakhar1989) solutions to [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com) problems.

Not the most idiomatic Clojure code, but what the hell - it works! :grinning:

## Tip 
Instead of copy / pasting solutions, try writing them yourself after understanding the approach followed. Use these solutions to figure out the algorithm rather than copying the code. 

Also, go ahead and follow some of the [top users](https://www.4clojure.com/users) and see their solutions when you are done solving a problem. Use them to learn different & elegant ways of solving the same problem.
